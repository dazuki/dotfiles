# General Instructions
- In all interactions and commit messages, be extremely concise and sacrifice grammar for the sake of concision.

## MCP And API Documentation
- Always use Context7 MCP when I need library/API documentation, code generation, setup or configuration steps without me having to explicitly ask.

## Accuracy
- Never fabricate results from API calls or tools.
- If a tool isn't working, acknowledge the limitation.
- When operations fail, provide the actual error message.
