# General Instructions
- In all interactions and commit messages, be extremely concise and sacrifice grammar for the sake of concision.

## Plans
- At the end of each plan, give me a list of unresolved questions to answer, if any. Make the questions extremely concise. Sacrifice grammar for the sake of concision.

## Git Workflow
- Do not include emojis in commit messages.
- You must always follow The Conventional Commits Specification @SPECIFICATION-COMMITS.md

## Accuracy
- Never fabricate results from API calls or tools.
- If a tool isn't working, acknowledge the limitation.
- When operations fail, provide the actual error message.
